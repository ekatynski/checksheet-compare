## checksheet-compare
This program is supposed to be able to navigate through two standard checksheets, tally the test cases for reach feature, scrape every feature for category (tab), examine every category in the sheet, full join the lists of categories across the checksheets, full join the feature lists of each category, report the number of test cases in each condition for both checksheets under the common feature and category lists, and finally compare the two subtractively in a chart format to compare scope and results.
